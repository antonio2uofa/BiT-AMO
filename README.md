# BiT-AMO
Repository that Antonio will be using for the BiT experiment

To test the code it is necessary to be running this experiment on the 32-bit Windows machine. Before running the experiment open Visual Studio Command Prompt 2010 and cd into "C:\Users\OPCUSER\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\venv\RTDACUSB\BiT-AMO". I am currently using this directory for testing and it will be subject to change in the future. When in the right directory run "nmake all". The C executables will be compiled and all the python code will be able to be run.
